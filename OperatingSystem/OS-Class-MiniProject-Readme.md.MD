# Round Robin CPU Scheduler

This is a simple C++ program that simulates a Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. The program allows you to create processes with specified burst times and runs the Round Robin scheduling algorithm on them.

## Instructions

1. **Compile the Code:**
    - Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code. For example:
      ```bash
      g++ main.cpp -o scheduler
      ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
    - Execute the compiled program. For example:
      ```bash
      ./scheduler
      ```

3. **Enter Time Quantum:**
    - Input the time quantum when prompted.

4. **Observe Output:**
    - The program will simulate the execution of processes using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm and display the output.
